"You're going to be okay. This is only temporary. The room might feel crowded, but... ...try thinking about something that makes you feel comfortable... ...and FOCUS on it." "FOCUS" is a first-person 3D puzzle game where things aren't always what they first seem. Dive into this experience, solving puzzles as you learn good tips on how to handle anxiety. Take a deep breath, try different points of view, and FOCUS.
